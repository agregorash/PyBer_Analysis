# PyBer Ride-Share Analysis

## Project Overview

Shortly after starting as an analyst for a ride-sharing company, PyBer, I have been tasked with analyzing two sets of data, [city_data.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv) in order to discover trends that exist amongst three categories of city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  After merging the data sets through their common variable, city name, I was able to calculate total counts and averages of the three main variables: rides, drivers  and fares.  Finally, I visualized the results through various types of charts and graphs in Jupyter Notebooks, in order to present the findings to the CEO and offer analytics driven business proposals for improvement.

## Resources
- Data Sources: [city_data.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv), [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/agregorash/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv)
               
 - Software: Python 3.8.3, Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda 3
